Repository for the Advanced Programming course's project (A.Y. 2020-2021)

## How to compile and run
In order to produce the final executable file, a *Makefile* is provided
and the following commands can be run in the shell from the root directory
of the project:
- `make all` allows to clean, build and execute the program;
- `make clean` allows to remove (if present) the directory with all the
executable files;
- `make build` allows to build the executable files for the program;
- `make run` allows to run the program (if executable files are already built).
